## Don't Throw It All Away 

Baby don't throw it all away   
I know you're crying everyday   
I know you feel that life is cruel
  
But I will be looking out for you
  
So don't stop dreaming
Keep believing
Trust your heart to find the light
Take your time you'll realize
Life doesn't have to be a fight
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
Baby don't take it all for granted
I know you feel that you are stranded
And I know you think you're all alone
But I will always bring you home
So don't stop dreaming
Keep believing
Trust your heart to find the light
Take your time you'll realize
Life doesn't have to be a fight
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
