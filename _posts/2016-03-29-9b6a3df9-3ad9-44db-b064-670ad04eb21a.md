## Oh my love

Oh my love where are you now  
I'm sorry for the things I've done  
you have always been the one  
I feel so lost now you are gone

I thought I knew what was on your mind  
I thought I understood the signs  
But now I see that I was really blind  
Somewhere back we crossed a line  
All our bridges have been burnt  
We're at a point of no return

Oh my love what can I do  
I know now what you have been through  
I never really saw the real you  
I never really had a clue

I thought I knew what was on your mind  
I thought I understood the signs  
But now I see that I was really blind  
Somewhere back we crossed a line  
All our bridges have been burnt  
We're at a point of no return

Oh my love can you forgive me  
There's so much I didn't see  
So much I held on to so stubbornly  
I know I have to set you free
