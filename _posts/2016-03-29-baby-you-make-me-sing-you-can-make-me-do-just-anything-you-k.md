## I CARRY YOUR SMILE IN MY HEART

Baby you make me sing
  
you can make me do just anything
  
You knock me off my feet   
your kisses are so soft and sweet
  
My heart just skips a beat
  
When I see you walking down the street
  
And no matter what tomorrow brings my love

Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
  
Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
  
You'll always be a part of me
wherever you are 'cause
  
Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart 

Time and time again
  
I'll choose the road that twist and bend
  
But Baby you make me feel
  
this time I can make it for real
  
Rainy days just slips by
  
when I've got you by my side
  
And no matter what tomorrow brings my love 

Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
  
Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
  
You'll always be a part of me
wherever you are 'cause
  
Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart 

Beneath the deep blue sheltering sky
  
we dream our dreams and wonder why
  
but its gonna be fine just you wait and see
  
all the start are aligned for you and me 

Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
  
Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
  
You'll always be a part of me
wherever you are 'cause
  
Uh uhh I carry your smile in my heart
