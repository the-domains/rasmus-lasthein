## Kiss Me Blind

Kiss me blind
  
And take me swimming in the lake
  
Hold my hand
  
And make me a promise you'll never break
  
Sing me a song
  
With stolen words from broken dreams
  
Keep me safe
  
When nothing is quite what it seems 

Every second of every hour
  
Through all our joys and all our sorrows
  
And even when we drift apart
  
I can Always feel you in my heart
  
I choose you
  
I choose you 

Take me in you arms   
And hold me tight when I'm falling
  
Lead me back home
  
When I loose myself and trouble comes calling
  
Shine a light
  
Whenever I can't find my way
  
Look me in the eyes
  
When there is nothing more to say
