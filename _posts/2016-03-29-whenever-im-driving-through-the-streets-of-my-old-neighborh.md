## The Little Things

Whenever I'm driving through the streets of my old neighborhood  
And I think about the time when I was living there  
Those memories of life are filled with endless summer days  
The sun is shining and the sky is clear  
Sunny days they come and go

You can try and guess but never really know  
What's dawning and what tomorrow brings  
Just keep your head high and find joy in the little things  
Listen deep and find the tune that makes your heart sing  
Then get on up and keep on walking

Whenever I pass the orchard where we used to go exploring  
I can almost taste the first kiss that I got there  
And all I hear is a soft humming from the honey bees  
And I can almost see you hiding there behind those trees

Life is like a box of chocolates you never know just what you get  
And no body knows what tomorrow brings  
Just keep your head high and find joy in the little things  
Listen deep and find the tune that make your heart sing  
Then get on up and keep on walking

NOTER:

I Feel the pull of the seasons flow

We can try to guess but never really know

What's coming and what tomorrow brings

So I keep my head high and find joy in the little things

Good times / sunny days

they come and go

You can try and guess

but never really know

What's coming

What tomorrow brings

So keep your head high

and find joy in the little things
