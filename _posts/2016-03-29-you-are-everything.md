YOU ARE EVERYTHING

Baby don't say goodbye
  
don't leave just yet
  
don't tell no lies
  
better leave it all unsaid 

Please just hear me out
  
please believe in me
  
please trust me now
  
baby can't you see  

You are oh yeah you are baby you are  
everything to me

I know its not easy for you   
I know you've been hurt before   
I know that love can be so cruel   
But baby it's not gonna hurt no more 

You are
you are
you are
everything to me
Bridge:
Feel the truth follow your heart
you know we were never meant to be apart
Come on baby dry your eyes
I know we can make if just we try (cause)
